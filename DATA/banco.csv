Capture and conversion of CO 2 into fuels and chemicals offers opportunities to mitigate the increasing CO 2 buildup, while simultaneously adding value to CO 2. The main limitation in CO 2 conversion is its high thermodynamic stability, thus requiring catalysts and energy input to drive the transformation.
